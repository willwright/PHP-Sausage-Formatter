This is a fork of Adam Goucher's PHP Formatter for Selenium IDE.
Example build scripts via Adam Goucher : http://adam.goucher.ca/?p=1331

Description:
Provides "Sausage" exporter for use with SauceLabs (https://saucelabs.com) and the PHP framework Sausage (https://github.com/jlipps/sausage)

Developer Notes:
This repo is very much a work in progress.  I've created exports for most the "basic" Selenium IDE commands, but not all
of them have export translations.

Installation Instructions:
# Download sauceformatters.xpi
# Open FireFox
# Navigate to: Tools > Add-ons > Click the "gear" in the top right > Choose "Install Add-on from File..." > Locate
"sauceformatters.xpi" in file chooser dialog and open
